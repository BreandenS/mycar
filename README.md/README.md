The Car Safety System is a Python script designed to simulate a basic car startup procedure. It ensures that only authorized drivers can start the car, checks the battery level, and verifies that the seatbelt is fastened before allowing the car to start. The script also monitors seatbelt status while the car is in motion to ensure safety.
